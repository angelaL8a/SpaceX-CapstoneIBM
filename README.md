## üåå **Introduction** <a name="introduction"></a>

The commercialization of space travel has revolutionized space exploration. **SpaceX** is at the forefront of this revolution, consistently launching reusable rockets, reducing launch costs, and increasing the success rate of missions. This project focuses on analyzing **SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data** and predicting launch outcomes using various machine learning models.

In this project, we:

- Investigate relationships between **launch sites**, **payload mass**, and **booster versions** to success rates.
- Apply predictive models like **SVM**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Decision Trees** for launch outcome predictions.
- Tune hyperparameters for optimized performance.

### Key Insights:

- **Highest Success Rate Launch Site**: üöÄ **KSC-LC-39A** with a 76.9% success rate.
- **Optimal Payload Range for Success**: üì¶ **2,000kg - 6,000kg** has the highest success.
- **Lowest Success Rate Payload**: ‚öñÔ∏è **7,000kg - 10,000kg** range experiences lower success.
- **Most Reliable Booster Version**: üîß **FT version** has demonstrated the highest reliability.

EDA was performed using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to visualize these insights. Additionally, we created interactive dashboards using **Plotly** and **Dash** to dynamically explore the data.

## üß† **Predictive Analysis (Machine Learning)** <a name="ml"></a>

We explored different classification models to predict launch outcomes. Our process included:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   ‚Üí Standardization of features (payload mass, booster version, etc.).  
   ‚Üí Train-test split (80%-20%) to validate model performance.  

2. **Model Development**:

   ‚Üí **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**  
   ‚Üí **Decision Trees**  
   ‚Üí **Logistic Regression**  
   ‚Üí **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:  
   We performed a grid search over key parameters for each model to ensure optimal performance.

4. **Evaluation**:  
   Models were evaluated using **accuracy** on the train set. Cross-validation was employed to mitigate overfitting.
